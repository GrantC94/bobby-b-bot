YES, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME... BUT I STILL REMEMBER EVERY FACE!
SHE SHOULD BE ON A HILL SOMEWHERE WITH THE SUN AND THE CLOUDS ABOVE HER!
FORCED TO MIND THE DOOR WHILE YOUR KING EATS AND DRINKS AND SHITS AND FUCKS!
IT MUST WOUND YOUR PRIDE! STANDING OUT THERE, LIKE A GLORIFIED SENTRY!
EASY, BOY! YOU MIGHT BE MY BROTHER BUT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THE KING!
HE COULD HAVE LINGERED ON THE EDGE OF THE BATTLE WITH THE SMART BOYS, AND TODAY HIS WIFE WOULD BE MAKING HIM MISERABLE, HIS SONS WOULD BE INGRATES, AND HE WOULD BE WAKING THREE TIMES IN THE NIGHT TO PISS INTO A BOWL!
GODS I WAS STRONG THEN
YOU'RE THE KING'S HAND! YOU'LL DO AS I COMMAND, OR I'LL FIND ME A HAND WHO WILL!
YOU'RE MY COUNCIL, COUNSEL! SPEAK SENSE TO THIS HONORABLE FOOL!
IS THAT WHAT EMPTY MEANS??
STOP THIS MADNESS, IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!
WEAR IT IN SILENCE, OR I'LL HONOR YOU AGAIN!
THEY NEVER TELL YOU HOW THEY ALL SHIT THEMSELVES! THEY DON'T PUT THAT PART IN THE SONGS!
YOU GOT FAT!
A DOTHRAKI HORDE ON AN OPEN FIELD, NED!
GODS WHAT A STUPID NAME!
SURROUNDED BY LANNISTERS! EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES I SEE THEIR BLONDE HAIR AND THEIR SMUG, SATISFIED FACES!
THE WHORE IS PREGNANT!
WHO NAMED YOU? SOME HALFWIT WITH A STUTTER??
SOON ENOUGH, THAT CHILD WILL SPREAD HER LEGS AND START BREEDING!
COME, BOW BEFORE YOUR KING! BOW, YA SHITS!
WE'RE TELLING WAR STORIES! WHO WAS YOUR FIRST KILL, NOT COUNTING OLD MEN?
WINE! WINE! MOOOOOOOOAR WINE!
DO YOU THINK IT'S HONOR THAT'S KEEPING THE PEACE?! IT'S FEAR! FEAR AND BLOOD!
I'VE GOT SEVEN KINGDOMS TO RULE! ONE KING, SEVEN KINGDOMS!
DID YOU EVER MAKE THE EIGHT?
PISS ON THAT! SEND A RAVEN! I WANT YOU TO STAY! I'M THE KING, I GET WHAT I WANT
